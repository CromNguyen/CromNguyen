# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm CromNguyen 

I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in IT. I have over 5 years of experience working as a Frontend Developer. My passion lies in Frontend Engineering, where I enjoy creating beautiful, high-performance products that offer a delightful user experience.

I am currently employed at Gapo Technology JSC, where I have contributed to the development of GapoWork, a digital workplace designed to enhance collaboration within companies. My work involved developing key features such as timekeeping and ticket management, as well as fixing bugs in other features. Additionally, I created utility tools that improved the developer experience for my team.
